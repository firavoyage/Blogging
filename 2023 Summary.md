# 2023 Summary

At the end of every year people always make a sum up about what they have done.
You may see some of them on ruanyf's blog,codeforces.com.
For me, I finished junior high school with not such a hight score in high school entrance exam.
But it was just the beginning of my life in Dajing HS.
I had a few boring trips in summer vacation.
I achieved No1 in the first exam at school but in fact it was meaningless.
In Oct, I picked up my Lv1 GI account which was quickly abandoned after I reg it in July2021.
I also played CR,BS,IdV,some galgames and some retro offline games a lot and it was really fun.
I attempted to build friendships with some of my classmates but actually it turned out that I was too young and too naive.
I progressed further in English, Math and OI.
I would like to pick up my interest in Physics and Chemistry in the next year;
To my wish, I will achieve more in the subjects I love and widen my impact on internet.
