canon pixma e470 isnt on sys list

sync repos between gitee & github...
It needs a gh api key.
after I uploaded the gh_key on github,
github detected it & automatically revoked it
so gitee can no longer keep sync
it took me a lot of time to find out what happened,
I did so just for my inablity to recognize the keys
finally here comes the solution{
gh/keysabc/keysdef
}
yeah I just splitted it.

learning git...
although I can upload files online,
but there's memory limit & it's a waste of time
so many thing just cant be done without git (qwq)...
maybe I should follow the examples & 
avoid learning the whole git methods
